## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm new to Github so still finding my way around.

I'm currently learning C++ programming having previously used only VBA and basic.

Since I'm a sailplane pilot, my first project is exploring and tinkering with the SoftRF (originated by Lyusupov) Skyview EZ device.  As a starting point I have used the Moshe M06b code (which I think is based on Lyuspov revision 0.12).

I have set myself the following goals:
1.  Enable the radar and text screens to display in landscape view with a selector in the web interface.  Achieved, but needs tidy up.
2.  Develop an additional screen with navigation information for tug retrieves.
